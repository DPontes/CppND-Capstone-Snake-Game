# CPPND: Capstone Snake Game

This project is cloned from the Capstone project in the [Udacity C++ Nanodegree Program](https://www.udacity.com/course/c-plus-plus-nanodegree--nd213). The code for this repo was inspired by [this](https://codereview.stackexchange.com/questions/212296/snake-game-in-c-with-sdl) excellent StackOverflow post and set of responses.

This project was chosen due to the lack of time to complete it given the developer's situation.

## Dependencies for Running Locally
* cmake >= 3.7
  * All OSes: [click here for installation instructions](https://cmake.org/install/)
* make >= 4.1 (Linux, Mac), 3.81 (Windows)
  * Linux: make is installed by default on most Linux distros
  * Mac: [install Xcode command line tools to get make](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/features/)
  * Windows: [Click here for installation instructions](http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/make.htm)
* SDL2 >= 2.0
  * All installation instructions can be found [here](https://wiki.libsdl.org/Installation)
  * Note that for Linux, an `apt` or `apt-get` installation is preferred to building from source.
* gcc/g++ >= 5.4
  * Linux: gcc / g++ is installed by default on most Linux distros
  * Mac: same deal as make - [install Xcode command line tools](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/features/)
  * Windows: recommend using [MinGW](http://www.mingw.org/)

## Basic Build Instructions

1. Clone this repo.
2. Make a build directory in the top level directory: `mkdir build && cd build`
3. Compile: `cmake .. && make`
4. Run it: `./SnakeGame`.

## Enhancements to the game

## Project Requirements (Rubric)

The rubric for this project has been translated into Automated Github Issues which can be followed in the [Project Kanban Board](https://github.com/DPontes/CppND-Capstone-Snake-Game/projects/1)

### README

#### A README with instructions is included in the project

This information can be found above in this README file

#### The README includes information about each rubric point addressed

Well, you're looking at it :)

#### The README indicates which project was chosen

Again, this information can be found above in this file

### Loops, Functions and I/O

#### The project demonstrates an understanding of C++ functions and control structures

#### The project reads data from a file or writes data to a file

#### The project accepts user input and processes the input

The base code from Udacity's repository already includes the acceptance of user input to move the snake in the game.

### Object Oriented Programming

#### The project used Object Oriented Programming techniques

The base code from Udacity's repository is already organized into classes, with attributes and methods.

#### Classes use appropriate access specifiers for class members

#### Class constructors utilize member initialization lists

#### Classes abstract implementation details from their interfaces

#### Classes encapsulate behaviour

#### Classes follow an appropriate inheritance hierarchy

#### Overloaded functions allow the same function to operate on different parameters

#### Derived class functions override virtual base class functions

#### Template generalize functions in the project

### Memory Management

#### The project makes use of references in function declarations

#### The project uses destructors appropriately

#### The project uses [Resource Aquisition Is Initialization (RAII)](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/raii) where appropriate

#### The project follows the [Rule Of 5](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/rule_of_three)

#### The project uses `move` semantics to move, instead of copying, data (where possible)

#### The project uses smart pointers instead of raw pointers

### Concurrency

#### The project uses multithreading

#### A promise and future are used in the project

#### A mutex or lock is used in the project

#### A condition variable is used
